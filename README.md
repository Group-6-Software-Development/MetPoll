# MetPoll

**Software Engineering Project Repository**

## Project Overview

MetPoll is a polling application designed to enhance communication between teachers and students. It enables teachers to track lecture performance and gather valuable feedback on their teaching effectiveness.

## Key Features

- Collects real-time feedback on lecture performance from students.
- Provides teachers with insights into the effectiveness of their lectures.
- React-based frontend for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- Python/Flask backend for handling data and managing server-side logic.

## Project Structure

This repository is divided into two main parts:

- **Frontend**: A React-based user interface that allows students to interact with the polling system.
- **Backend**: A Python/Flask server that processes requests, manages data, and handles business logic.

## Instructions

### Frontend Setup

For detailed instructions on how to set up and run the frontend, refer to the [Frontend README](./frontend/README.md).

### Backend Setup

For detailed instructions on how to set up and run the backend, refer to the [Backend README](./backend/README.md).

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React
- **Backend**: Python with Flask
